## ✅ Topic Covered
Data Structures in R

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on **data structures in R**, which are essential for organizing and storing data efficiently. Data structures help reduce **memory usage** and improve **computation speed**, which is crucial in **data analytics** when working with large datasets.  

We explored four main types of data structures in R: **vectors, lists, matrices, and arrays**. Each structure has its own characteristics and use cases. Understanding these structures allows us to store and manipulate data effectively, whether it’s a simple list of numbers or a multi-dimensional dataset.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- **Vectors:** One-dimensional homogeneous collections of data, created using `c()`. Functions include `length()`, `sort()`, `rep()`, and `seq()`.  
- **Lists:** One-dimensional heterogeneous collections, created using `list()`. Can access elements using indexing, check existence with `%in%`, combine lists with `c()`, and append elements.  
- **Matrices:** Two-dimensional homogeneous structures, created using `matrix()`. Rows run horizontally, columns vertically. Functions include accessing elements, deleting rows/columns, combining matrices with `cbind()` and `rbind()`, and checking dimensions with `dim()`.  
- **Arrays:** Multi-dimensional homogeneous structures, created using `array()`. Can store data in 1D or n-dimensional form. Functions include accessing elements, checking length with `length()`, and dimensions with `dim()`.  

## 💻 Activity
- Created **vectors** and practiced functions like `length()`, `sort()`, `rep()`, and `seq()`  
- Built **lists** with heterogeneous elements and accessed elements using indexing  
- Created **matrices**, performed row and column operations, and combined matrices using `cbind()` and `rbind()`  
- Worked with **arrays** and explored multi-dimensional indexing and dimension functions  

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
Remembering the syntax and functions for each data structure, especially **arrays** with multiple dimensions, was challenging. Understanding how to efficiently use these structures for **real-world data analysis** required practice.

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Mastering data structures is crucial for **data storage, manipulation, and analysis** in R. Each structure has its own strengths, and knowing when to use vectors, lists, matrices, or arrays is fundamental for any data analytics task.
