## ✅ Topic Covered
Advanced Data Visualization and Plot Combination in R

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on **combining multiple plots** to create **dashboards, comparative visuals, or multi-panel figures** in R. Combining plots is crucial for presenting insights in a **concise and visually appealing manner**, especially when analyzing multiple variables or datasets together.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- **Combining plots using `patchwork`**  
  - Allows arranging multiple `ggplot2` plots easily using operators like `+` and `/`  
  - Enables flexible layout designs for comparative visualization  

- **Combining plots using `cowplot`**  
  - Provides advanced alignment and annotation tools  
  - Useful for creating professional multi-panel figures for reports and publications  

- **Benefits of combining plots:**  
  - Visual comparison of multiple datasets or variables  
  - Improved readability and presentation of insights  
  - Enables creation of **mini dashboards** within R  

## 💻 Activity
- Installed and loaded `patchwork` and `cowplot` packages  
- Created multiple `ggplot2` plots (scatter, line, box)  
- Arranged plots side by side and in grids using `patchwork`  
- Experimented with alignment, labels, and plot annotations using `cowplot`  

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
- Understanding **syntax differences** between `patchwork` and `cowplot`  
- Properly aligning plots of different sizes for a clean layout  
- Adding annotations without cluttering the visualization  

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Combining plots is essential for **effective comparative analysis** and creating **professional visual reports** in R. Libraries like `patchwork` and `cowplot` make it easier to present **multiple plots in a structured, readable format**.
