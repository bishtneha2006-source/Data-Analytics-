## ✅ Topic Covered
Setup of R Studio and Introduction to R Language for Data Analytics

## 🧠 Summary
Today marked the beginning of our **R programming and Data Analytics journey**. We started by installing **R** and **RStudio**, setting up the environment for coding and data analysis.  

We then explored **variables** — containers that store values — and learned three ways to assign them in R: using assignment operators, arrows, and double arrows. Next, we covered **operators**, including arithmetic and logical operators, which are fundamental for performing calculations and comparisons on datasets.  

This session gave us a **strong foundation for data analysis** — before we can manipulate datasets or build models, we need to understand how to store and handle data efficiently.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- Installing R and RStudio for data analysis  
- Declaring variables using different methods  
- Performing arithmetic and logical operations  
- Understanding how operators are crucial in **data cleaning and transformation**  
- Recognizing the role of variables and operators in **data analytics workflows**  

## 💻 Activity
- Installed **R** and **RStudio** on our machines  
- Created variables using assignment, arrows, and double arrows  
- Practiced arithmetic operations to manipulate numeric data  
- Discussed how these basics will help in **data analysis tasks** like calculating averages, totals, and comparing datasets  

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
Keeping track of different ways to declare variables and understanding operator precedence. Also, realizing how even basic operations form the backbone of more complex **data analytics calculations**.

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Mastering variables and operators is essential. These basics form the foundation for **data manipulation, analysis, and visualization** in R — the core of any data analytics project.
