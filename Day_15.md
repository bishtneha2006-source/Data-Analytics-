# 📘 Day 15

## ✅ Topic Covered
Time Series Analysis and 2D/3D Visualization in R

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on **time series modeling** and **visualizing data in 2D and 3D formats** for deeper insights. Time series analysis helps in **forecasting and understanding trends over time**, while advanced visualizations make data more **interpretable and interactive**.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- **ARIMA Models**  
  - Used for **forecasting and analyzing time-dependent data**  
  - Combines autoregressive (AR), integrated (I), and moving average (MA) components  
  - Helps in identifying trends, seasonality, and residual errors in time series  

- **Leafmap in R**  
  - For creating **interactive geographic maps**  
  - Allows overlaying points, polygons, and markers for spatial data visualization  
  - Useful in **location-based analytics and geospatial insights**  

- **2D and 3D Visualizations**  
  - 2D: Line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots  
  - 3D: Surface plots, 3D scatter plots using `plotly` or `rgl`  
  - Enhances the **visual interpretation of complex datasets**  

- **Benefits of 2D/3D Visualizations:**  
  - Helps identify patterns and trends quickly  
  - Improves **decision-making through intuitive graphics**  
  - Enables **interactive exploration** of large datasets  

## 💻 Activity
- Created sample time series data and applied **ARIMA modeling**  
- Visualized predictions and trends using line plots  
- Generated **interactive maps** using `leafmap`  
- Practiced 2D and 3D plots for different datasets  
- Explored interactive features in `plotly` and `rgl`  

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
- Understanding **ARIMA parameters** (p, d, q) for accurate forecasting  
- Aligning interactive map features with dataset attributes  
- Plotting 3D data with correct axes and scaling  

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Mastering **time series analysis** and **advanced 2D/3D visualizations** allows us to **extract actionable insights** and present them in **interactive and engaging formats**, making data analysis more impactful.
