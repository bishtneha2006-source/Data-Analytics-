## ✅ Topic Covered
Control Structures in R

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on **control structures in R**, which are essential for making decisions and performing repeated operations in programming. We explored **if** and **if-else if** statements to handle conditional logic, and **for** and **while** loops to automate repetitive tasks.  

We also learned about **break** and **next** statements, which help control loop execution — either stopping it early or skipping certain iterations. Understanding these concepts is crucial in **data analytics**, for tasks like filtering datasets, processing data row by row, or applying conditions to clean and transform data efficiently.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- **If condition:** Execute code when a condition is true  
- **If-else if condition:** Handle multiple conditional branches  
- **For loop:** Iterate over a sequence of values  
- **While loop:** Repeat actions while a condition holds true  
- **Break statement:** Stop a loop prematurely  
- **Next statement:** Skip the current iteration in a loop  

## 💻 Activity
- Practiced writing **if** and **if-else if** conditions for different scenarios  
- Implemented **for** loops to iterate over sequences of numbers  
- Used **while** loops to perform repeated operations  
- Applied **break** to stop loops early and **next** to skip certain iterations  
- Discussed how these structures can be used in **data analytics workflows**, like filtering rows or iterating through datasets conditionally  

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
Differentiating between **if-else if** and multiple **if** statements, and avoiding infinite loops with **while**. Understanding when to use **break** and **next** effectively was also a bit tricky.

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Control structures are the backbone of **decision-making and iteration in R**. Mastering them is key for **data manipulation, automation, and efficient data analytics**.
