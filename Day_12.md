# 📘 Day 12

## ✅ Topic Covered
Data View Manipulation and Advanced Visualization in R using `tidyr`, `reshape2`, and `ggplot2`

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on **reshaping and visualizing data**. We learned how to convert datasets between **wide and long formats** for analysis.  

We then explored **advanced visualization using `ggplot2`** with **box plots, scatter plots, density plots, and line plots** to understand distributions, trends, and relationships.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` for data reshaping  
- Box Plot, Scatter Plot, Density Plot, and Line Plot using `ggplot2`  
- Customizing plot aesthetics: colors, labels, and themes  

## 💻 Activity
- Reshaped datasets into long and wide formats  
- Created multiple plots using `ggplot2`  
- Compared plots to understand data representation  

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
- Choosing the **correct plot type**  
- Learning **ggplot2 syntax and layers**  
- Adjusting plot aesthetics for meaningful visualization  

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Mastering **data reshaping and visualization** is essential for **insightful data analysis** and effective communication of results.
