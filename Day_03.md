## ✅ Topic Covered
Functions in R

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on **functions in R**, which are modular units of code designed to perform specific tasks. Functions help in **code reuse, organization, and simplifying complex data operations**, making them essential in **data analytics** workflows.  

We learned about **user-defined functions** and **built-in functions**, and explored different types of functions including functions without arguments, functions with arguments, functions with default arguments, nested functions, recursion, and functions interacting with global and local variables. Understanding these concepts will allow us to write efficient, reusable code for data manipulation, analysis, and automation.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- **User-defined functions:** Create reusable code blocks with `function()`  
- **Function without arguments:** Simple tasks that don’t require input  
- **Function with arguments:** Passing values to customize function behavior  
- **Default arguments:** Predefined values used if no input is given  
- **Nested functions:** Functions defined inside another function  
- **Recursion:** A function calling itself for repetitive tasks  
- **Local vs Global variables:** Scope of variables inside and outside functions  

## 💻 Activity
- Defined and called **functions without arguments**  
- Created **functions with parameters** and passed arguments  
- Experimented with **default arguments** in functions  
- Built **nested functions** to understand inner and outer function interactions  
- Practiced **recursion** for iterative tasks  
- Explored **global and local variable behavior** inside functions  

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
Understanding variable scope and how **global variables behave differently** when redefined inside functions was a bit tricky. Also, recursion requires careful handling to avoid infinite loops.

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Functions are the building blocks of **clean, modular, and reusable code** in R. Mastering them is crucial for **data manipulation, automation, and advanced analytics tasks**.
